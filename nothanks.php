        <h2>Work with a Professional Team</h2>
        <p>Our experienced team of professionals understands the unique needs of investors and as such is here to offer full support to your success.</p>
        <p><b>Our Core Service</b></p>
        <p>With the ever increasing complexity of anti-money laundering regulations, opening and running a brokerage account with an EU regulated investment firm has become more difficult, especially for clients based outside of the EU. One of our roles is to manage smoothly this whole process and enable our clients to open their brokerage account and do business as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>We can work with the regulated EU investment firm with whom we have a relationship to open up an account and establish safe custody procedures. We can also act as the agent collecting your Know-Your-Client (KYC) documentation to help minimise delays and contain administration costs.</p>
