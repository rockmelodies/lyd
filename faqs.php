		<div id="accordion">
			<h3 class="qs">How and why do you verify my identity?</h3>

			<div>Identity verification is an important anti-fraud and identity protection measure. It helps the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. We carry out electronic checks (now and in the future) with an agency which might also verify your financial standing and retain a record of our enquiries. If we can't verify your identity electronically, we'll ask you for additional documentation.</div>

			<h3 class="qs">What is a KYC and why do I need it?</h3>

			<div>KYC, otherwise known as Know Your Customer or Client, refers to due diligence act that financial institutions and other regulated companies must perform to ascertain relevant information from their client for the purpose of doing business with them. The term is also used to refer to bank regulation which governs these activities. Know your customer processes are employed by companies of all sizes for the purpose of ensuring their proposed agents, consultants, or distributors anti -bribery compliance. And it is a best practice routinely used by all good financial institutions. The information provided by clients is used to verify probity and integrity and is becoming increasingly important globally to prevent identity fraud and money laundering. </div>

			<h3 class="qs">What information do I need to submit as KYC?</h3>

			<div>You will need to submit two pieces of information that will verify 1) Who you are and 2) Where you live.<br /><br />
                             To confirm your identity, we require a Government issued photo ID such as s such as a valid Passport, if you do not have a Passport, kindly submit a valid ID Card or Drivers License.<br /><br />
                             To confirm where you live, we need something in your name which shows your address. This should be from a utility company for power, water, from the bank or a phone company.  Please note that these must be no older than 3 months old, otherwise your KYC will not be approved and you will have to submit current documents. In both cases, these must be clear scanned copies of original documents, preferably in colour and must show your full name and current address. </div>

			<h3 class="qs">Why do I need to Submit Passport /ID upload & Proof of address</h3>

			<div>In order to activate your account, you must provide us with proof of identification. Acceptable proof of Identity is a current passport or government issued national identity card.<br /><br />
			     Acceptable proof of domicile or address will be a utility bill clearly showing your full name and address. Please note that it must be a clean scanned copy  and no older than 3 months old.<br /><br />
			     In order to speed up the processing of your application, please colour scan your passport or identity card and upload the file in gif, jpeg, pdf or other readable formats.<br /><br />
			     Your account will not be activated unless your KYC has been verified. LydorMarkets has to go through a process of KYC controls to check the information you have submitted is correct. If you do not submit a clean scanned copy or your documents are out of date, we will ask you to re-submit new documentation and your account activation will remain pending your KYC approval. If you have any doubts, please refer to our FAQ's section explaining KYC documentation.</div>
