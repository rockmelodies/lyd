     <center><h2><font color=”#f60700”>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT</font></h2></center>
     Dear Visitor,<br><br>
As of today, LydorMarkets will no longer accept Bank Wire Transfer information via emails. Please use our New System instead of sending an email. The New System will provide the information in a much clearer format.<br><br>
Once the remittance has been made, you are requested to kindly <B>LOGIN</B> to the System using your Account Number and Password provided and click on the Payment/Deposit Details button. It is important that only <B>ONE</B> person in the entire group for whom the remittance is being made, does this.<br><br>
You may upload a maximum of 2 files (PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF) for the proof of remittance.<br><br>
In the First section of the Form kindly provide the Name of the Remitter, Email Address of the Remitter, Bank Account Number from where the Remittance was made, Amount Remitted and the Number of People for whom the remittance is being made. The person making the Remittance does note neccessarily have to be a Member.<br><br>
In the next section, you will notice that your Account Number, Name and Email is already listed. If you are making a remittance for more members, please click on <B>Add New</B> and in the left hand column enter the Members Account Number. The system will automatically fill in the name and email address which will not be visible to you as it will be showing only asterisks.<br><br>
Kindly continue clicking on <B>Add New</B> and entering the Members Account Number till you have listed all the Members that are being covered by your remittance. Once you have all of them in the system, please press <B>Submit</B>.<br><br>
Typically it will take between 2-3 days for a Wire Transfer to reach our Bank. Once we are in receipt of confirmation of your payment a confirmation email will be sent to each Member with directions on how to upload your KYC Documentation.<br><br>
<h3><font color=”#f60700”>Thank You.</font><h3><br><br>

        <h2>Work with a Professional Team</h2>
        <p>Our experienced team of professionals understands the unique needs of investors and as such is here to offer full support to your success.</p>
        <p><b>Our Core Service</b></p>
        <p>With the ever increasing complexity of anti-money laundering regulations, opening and running a brokerage account with an EU regulated investment firm has become more difficult, especially for clients based outside of the EU. One of our roles is to manage smoothly this whole process and enable our clients to open their brokerage account and do business as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>We can work with the regulated EU investment firm with whom we have a relationship to open up an account and establish safe custody procedures. We can also act as the agent collecting your Know-Your-Client (KYC) documentation to help minimise delays and contain administration costs.</p>
